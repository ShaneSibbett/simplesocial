Gie, 

This project (attached) was one that I modified from my Udemy course. I would like to get to as much as we can on this one. 

Problem 1)
A)  The thing I want to learn with this project is how to create a combination listview and formview all on one HTML file. 
I tried to create a conceptual HTML of what I want on the simplesocial\groups\templates\groups\group_list.html. 
I tried to create the form and figure this out on my own and made the simplesocial\groups\templates\groups\group_listform.html.
My attempt didn't work. 

B) Capture the post results from the form into the database.  

Problem 2)
develop a search version of problem 1) . I will try to create a search ListView on my own. The part that seams hard is the FormView on the same HTML. 

Problem 3)
If we have time talk about the requirement for getting objects.select_related to work to get the parent and child to show up. 
This project has it group_list.html but I know that I full get it. I was trying to do it again and got errors.

Thank you

Shane Sibbett
